## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

Ministry of Defence

## Idea
The Web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software is designed to enhance the recruitment and interview process for the Ministry of Defence (DRDO) by simulating a real-world boardroom interview scenario. This platform will provide both interviewers and candidates with a seamless interview experience, starting with initial ice-breaker questions and progressing to more in-depth, domain-specific questions depending on the candidate’s expertise. The system will evaluate the relevance of both questions and responses using advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, providing objective and data-driven insights into the candidate's technical and managerial proficiency. The ultimate goal is to provide quantifiable scores that reflect both the relevance of the questions and the quality of the answers, ensuring that the best candidate is selected based on their expertise and overall suitability for the advertised role.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The solution architecture will be based on a web-based application consisting of several key components. The frontend will serve as the user interface for both candidates and experts, providing an intuitive experience for question answering and evaluation. The backend server, built with technologies like Node.js and Python, will handle session management, API requests, and communication between the frontend and the AI engine. The AI engine will use machine learning models for both question relevance evaluation and automated answer scoring, ensuring a consistent and unbiased evaluation process. The database (using MongoDB for unstructured data and MySQL for structured data) will store user profiles, questions, interview logs, and evaluation metrics. The interview process will be dynamic, with the system filtering relevant questions based on the candidate’s profile and expertise area. The architecture ensures that data flows smoothly between each component, allowing for real-time interaction and scoring during the interview.

## Use Cases
The candidate profile setup is the first use case, where candidates fill out their profile detailing their expertise, education, and experience. This profile is used to tailor the interview process and ensure the questions asked are relevant to the candidate’s skills. The second use case involves the interview execution, where the expert (interviewer) selects the domain of expertise, and the system filters relevant questions for the candidate. The candidate then answers these questions, and both the expert and the system evaluate the response for relevance and depth. The final use case is the automated scoring and feedback system, where the system combines the scores from the expert’s manual judgment and the AI-generated score to produce an overall evaluation of the candidate’s performance. The system also generates a detailed feedback report that outlines strengths and areas for improvement based on the interview responses.

## Technology Stack
The technology stack for this solution will rely on modern web technologies for both the frontend and backend. For the frontend, frameworks like React.js or Angular will be used to create a responsive and interactive user interface, ensuring smooth communication between the user and the system. On the backend, Node.js with Express.js will handle API requests, server-side logic, and user management, while Python with Flask or Django will be used to process NLP tasks for evaluating candidate responses. The database will be a combination of MongoDB for unstructured data (such as candidate profiles and interview logs) and PostgreSQL/MySQL for structured data like scoring and question banks. For machine learning and NLP, libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch will be used to train models that assess the relevance of answers, while spaCy or NLTK will help in the semantic analysis of text. To ensure scalability, the solution will be hosted on cloud platforms such as AWS or Google Cloud, and Docker will be used for containerizing the application for easy deployment and management.

## Dependencies
The platform will have several dependencies for full functionality. For user authentication, third-party services like OAuth will be integrated to allow candidates and experts to securely log in. WebSockets will be employed for real-time communication, enabling the expert and candidate to interact seamlessly during the interview process. The NLP engine will depend on pre-trained models, such as those from spaCy, Hugging Face, or Google Cloud NLP API, for analyzing the relevancy of both questions and answers. For machine learning, custom models or pre-trained models will be used to assess the quality of responses based on keywords and contextual understanding. Additionally, Twilio may be used to facilitate live voice or video interviews, ensuring a more interactive experience if needed. To manage the system and ensure scalability, Docker and Kubernetes will be used to containerize the application, providing easy deployment and horizontal scaling. These dependencies, along with the integrated tools, will ensure that the platform is robust, scalable, and capable of handling large-scale recruitment processes efficiently.
